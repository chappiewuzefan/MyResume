## Hi, I'm Zefan

I build reliable backend systems, keep fleets of IoT devices in line, and occasionally write up the lessons learned. This site pulls everything into one place:

- **Resume** – the LaTeX source, PDF preview, and message board live at [zefanwu.com/resume]({{ '/resume/' | relative_url }}).
- **Blog** – short notes on development, ops, and experiments land in the [blog]({{ '/blog/' | relative_url }}) section.
- **Source** – the entire site (including LaTeX sources) is open on GitHub: [{{ site.github.repository_url }}]({{ site.github.repository_url }}).

Expect the home page to grow with project highlights and quick links as I ship more things.
